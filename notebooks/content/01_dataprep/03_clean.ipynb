    "## Data Cleaning Approach\n",
    "---\n",
    "The following describes our data cleaning process and steps, executed in the order listed. We begin with 'safe' techniques that carry minimal risk of compromising downstream cleaning tasks. For instance, UTF-8 encoding can impact the accuracy of language detection algorithms, especially if characters carry language-specific information. Removing special characters may compromise the detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as URLs and email addresses. As the process progresses, steps carry a greater impact on the data, its expressiveness, and representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our minimalist, task-specific, model-informed, *leave-as-is* data cleaning process unfolds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance**: Observations containing **non-English text or app names** will be removed to maintain linguistic uniformity within the dataset, which is crucial for consistent language-based analysis. \n",
    "2. **Uniqueness**: For duplicate review IDs, our policy for retention is based on review date. Retaining the most recent review prioritizes review recency, timeliness and relevance. Observations containing duplicate review text will be retained to maximize fidelity to customer experience and expression. \n",
    "3. **Privacy**: Personally identifiable information (PII) such as URLs, email addresses and phone numbers detected in the previous section are removed from the dataset to ensure adherence to data privacy and minimal information policies.\n",
    "4. **Validity**: Replace or remove artifacts, patterns, and noise that do not convey meaningful content, and may compromise dataset validity. Remediations include:\n",
    "    1. **Control Characters**: Remove HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;`, `&#39;`), and non-printable characters from the Unicode and ASCII character sets used to control text flow or hardware devices (e.g., newline, tab, or carriage return). These characters have no analytical value and can interfere with text processing.\n",
    "    2. **Diacritics and Accents**:  We normalize accented characters (e.g., converting `é` to `e`) to reduce unnecessary text variation, which simplifies analysis without compromising the meaning of the content.\n",
    "    3. **Elongation**: Elongated words (e.g., \"soooo\") convey emphasis in informal text, which is valuable for sentiment analysis. We use a threshold approach to limit characters that appear four or more times consecutively to a maximum of three (e.g., \"soooo\" becomes \"sooo\"), preserving emphasis while maintaining readability.\n",
    "    4. **Repetition**: Excess character, sequence, word and phrase repetition is reduced, but not eliminated to perserve artifacts that may signal emphasis.\n",
    "    5. **Special Characters**: Excessive special characters can indicate SPAM, emotional intensity, or nonsensical content. We apply a threshold: if special characters make up more than 35% of the review text, the review is removed.     \n",
    "    6. **Trim Whitespace**: We trim excess whitespace from review text.\n",
    "5. **Non-Informative Reviews**: Reviews that don't match minimum length criteria are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning Techniques Not Implemented\n",
    "---\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), text cleaning measures such as lower-casing, contraction and abbreviation expansion, spelling correction, and the removal of emoticons, emojis, and other artifacts are considered standard practice. Given that transformer models are fine-tuned on large user generated content datasets such as the IMDB Movie and SemEval Laptop Reviews dataset, they are highly adept at handling a wide variety of tokens, including emojis, spelling variations, abbreviations and contractions. So, we take a **leave emojis as-is** approach. By leveraging the inherent strengths of transformer - particularly their ability to tokenize subword units and learn from context — we preserve the natural, authentic nature of user-generated content.\n",
