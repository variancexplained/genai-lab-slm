Scholars have increased focus on unraveling the bias and fairness in models, also in relation to inherent biases in the input data. However, limited work exists on the representativity of samples (datasets) for appropriate inference in AI systems. This paper reviews definitions and notions of a representative sample and surveys their use in scientific AI literature. We introduce three measurable concepts to help focus the notions and evaluate different data samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contrast between a representative sample in the sense of coverage of the input space, versus a representative sample mimicking the distribution of the target population is of particular relevance when building AI systems. Through empirical demonstrations on US Census data, we evaluate the opposing inherent qualities of these concepts. Finally, we propose a framework of questions for creating and documenting data with data representativity in mind, as an addition to existing dataset documentation templates.},

However, customers might not always possess the required technical expertise to make commercially feasible suggestions. The value of customer reviews also varied due to their unmanageable volume and content irrelevance. In our study, over 189,000 user reviews with over 50 apps would be analyzed using review analysis and multivariate regression analysis to examine the impacts of innovation and improvement led by customers on app performance in terms of app revenues. The developers' lead time in responding to user reviews would be included as a moderator to investigate whether app performance would be enhanced if developers respond faster. This study should represent one of the first few attempts in offering empirical confirmation of the value of co-creation of apps with customers. The authors also present methodological contributions by establishing operationalization and analyses of user reviews.},

In contrast to previous works, our analysis thereby sheds light on the reception of reviews from a language-based perspective. For this purpose, we propose an intriguing text analysis approach based on distributed text representations and multi-instance learning to operationalize the two-sidedness of argumentation in review texts. A subsequent empirical analysis using a large corpus of Amazon reviews suggests that two-sided argumentation in reviews significantly increases their helpfulness. We find this effect to be stronger for positive reviews than for negative reviews, whereas a higher degree of emotional language weakens the effect. Our findings have immediate implications for retailer platforms, which can utilize our results to optimize their customer feedback system and to present more useful product reviews.},

This paper contributes to prior work by analyzing how rating and review information in combination impact mobile app downloads. To achieve these ends, we utilize daily panel data of 341 gaming (hedonic consumption value-oriented) and productivity (utilitarian consumption value-oriented) apps tracked for almost two years from their release in the Apple App Store. Hence, we contribute to how ratings and reviews matter for the larger majority of apps, whereas previous research has mainly focused on either ratings' or reviews' impact on app performance for top-ranked apps. Results of fixed-effects regression analysis reveal different combinatory impacts of text review information (polarity, subjectivity, and review length) and rating information (average rating score, volume of ratings, and dispersion of ratings) on gaming versus productivity app downloads. Important implications of the findings for app developers and platform providers, and for future research into online ratings and reviews, are discussed.},

@misc{stevejobsTalkStevenJobs1983,
  title = {Talk by {{Steven Jobs}} at the {{IDCA}}},
  author = {{Steve Jobs}},
  year = {1983},
  month = jun,
  urldate = {2024-06-21},
  abstract = {As described by Marcel Brown from the Life, Liberty and Technology weblog: In 1983, Steve Jobs gave a speech to a relatively small audience at a somewhat obscure event called the International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA). The theme of that year's conference was ``The Future Isn't What It Used To Be'', which looking back seems all too fitting. Circumstances being what they are, very little is available on the Internet regarding this Steve Jobs speech. In my extensive research, I could find only one recording of this talk, which itself was just posted in June of this year. This talk received a fair amount of attention at the end of August, after it was mentioned in a Smithsonian Magazine article written by Walter Issacson, Jobs' biographer. However, the recording currently available is not complete. It ends after about 20 minutes, which corresponds with the end of Jobs' prepared speech. Left out is almost 40 minutes of a follow-up question and answer session where Jobs offered incredible insight into his vision of future technology. I now present this recording to the world so that it may be preserved indefinitely. First, I'd like to thank one of my oldest clients, John Celuch of Inland Design. He personally attended this speech almost 30 years ago and was the one who gave me the recording I now share. Attendees of the speech received a cassette tape copy and he held on to it all these years. He found the tape sometime last year and thought I might like it. He was absolutely right, but because I was in the middle of a move (and also due to a lack cassette tape players available to me!) I set the tape aside and put off listening to it until this summer. Had I known what was in this recording, I would not have waited so long! Incidentally, John met Steve Jobs at this conference. During their interaction Steve Jobs gave him something to put in a time capsule that was buried at the conference. To our knowledge this time capsule has yet to be dug up.  After listening to the recording, I did some research in an attempt to find some pictures of this speech. I only found one source of pictures, courtesy of Arthur Boden via his son Ivan's Flicker account. Arthur had also personally attended this speech and took some pictures of Steve Jobs giving his talk. His son uncovered them while scanning some old slides and made them available on his Flicker account. To my knowledge, these may be the only known pictures of this speech. If anyone has any other pictures of this talk or any other Steve Jobs sightings at the conference, I'd love to know. Regarding the speech, it is amazing to hear Steve Jobs talk about some things that were not fully realized until only a handful of years ago. This talks shows us just how incredibly ahead of his time he was. I've listened to the entirety of the recording a few times now and have taken extensive notes, of which I will further elaborate on in future blog postings. But for now, here are a few of the highlights -- and remember -- he is speaking in 1983. To put that in context, the Macintosh had not yet been introduced, Apple still thought the Lisa was going to be a hit, and the IBM PC was the second most popular personal computer behind the Apple II series. He mentions that computers are so fast they are like magic. I don't think it is a coincidence that he called the iPad ``magical''. He states that in a few years people will be spending more time interacting with personal computers than with cars. It seems so obvious now, but hardly a given back then. He equates society's level of technology familiarity to being on a ``first date'' with personal computers. He recognized that technology would continue to evolve in the near future as would people's comfort level with it. In hindsight, once it became dominant the PC industry stood relatively still while Jobs was busy planning ``the next big thing''. He confidently talks about the personal computer being a new medium of communication. Again, this is before networking was commonplace or there was any inkling of the Internet going mainstream. Yet he specifically talks about early e-mail systems and how it is re-shaping communication. He matter-of-factly states that when we have portable computers with radio links, people could be walking around anywhere and pick up their e-mail. Again, this is 1983, at least 20 years before the era of mobile computing. He mentions an experiment done by MIT that sounds very much like a Google Street View application. He discusses early networking and the mess of different protocols that existed at the time. He predicts that we were about 5 years away from ``solving'' networking in the office and 10-15 years from solving networking in the home. I'd say he was pretty much dead-on. He says Apple's strategy is to ``put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you that you can learn how to use in 20 minutes''. Does that sound like anything we are familiar with today? And they wanted to do it with a ``radio link'' so that people wouldn't need to hook it up to anything to communicate with ``larger databases'' and other computers. Hmmm {\dots}. He compares the nascent software development industry to the record industry. He says that most people didn't necessarily know what computer they wanted to buy. In contrast, when walking into a record store they definitely knew what music they liked. This was because they got free samples of songs by listening to the radio. He thought that the software industry needed something like a radio station so that people could sample software before they buy it. He believed that software distribution through traditional brick-and-mortar was archaic since software is digital and can be transferred electronically through phone lines. He foresees paying for software in an automated fashion over the phone lines with credit cards. I don't know about you, but I think this sounds incredibly similar to the concept of the Apple App Store. Plus his comparison to the music industry just might be foreshadowing the iTunes store. You need to listen to the speech to hear the entirety of this passage for yourself. Right at the end of the Q\&A session, a question is asked about voice recognition, which he believed was the better part of a decade away from reality. Given the context of Siri today, it is interesting to hear him talk about the difficultly of recognizing language vs voice because language is contextually driven. He says, ``This stuff is hard''. So finally, here is my digitized recording of a ``Talk by Steven Jobs'' from the 1983 IDCA. The previously unavailable Q\&A session starts at about 21:30 of the recording. Note that most of the questions asked by the audience are unintelligible, but can generally be divined by the responses Steve Jobs gives.  I digitized the recording using Audacity and applied a simple noise filter to remove the tape hiss and saved it as MPEG-4 (M4A). Enjoy!},

But with so many apps out there, picking the right one can be tough. Plus, developing an app requires a lot of money and time, risking losses if it doesn't attract users. This study looks into how users are influenced by others' opinions and experiences when choosing and sticking with an app. Three theories--Social Impact Theory (SIT), Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), and Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2)--are combined to explain the process from download to continued use. Real mobile app usage data was analyzed. Results from 912 surveys and 87 real usage records show that people are swayed by download numbers, star ratings, and user satisfaction. The number of sources, immediacy, and power affect social impact. Social impact, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, price, habit, and confirmation also influence continued use intention. On average, people spend 2197\>s daily on smartphones. Tools \& Productivity is the most popular category, with an average of 29 apps used daily. These apps have 100M\,+\,downloads on average and a 4-star rating. The findings offer valuable insights for developers and marketers on what makes an app preferable and actively used among many choices.},

App review utilization helps project management teams to identify threads and opportunities for app software maintenance, optimization and strategic marketing purposes. Nevertheless, app user review classification for identifying valuable gems of information for app software improvement, is a complex and multidimensional issue. It requires foresight and multiple combinations of sophisticated text pre-processing, feature extraction and machine learning methods to efficiently classify app reviews into specific topics. Against this backdrop, we propose a novel feature engineering classification schema that is capable to identify more efficiently and earlier terms-words within reviews that could be classified into specific topics. For this reason, we present a novel feature extraction method, the DEVMAX.DF combined with different machine learning algorithms to propose a solution in app review classification problems. One step further, a simulation of a real case scenario takes place to validate the effectiveness of the proposed classification schema into different apps. After multiple experiments, results indicate that the proposed schema outperforms other term extraction methods such as TF.IDF and {$\chi$}2 to classify app reviews into topics. To this end, the paper contributes to the knowledge expansion of research and practitioners with the purpose to reinforce their decision-making process within the realm of app reviews utilization.},
